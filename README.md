js test task 1
Imagine that we have a rectangular playing field consisting of cells.
Each cell can contain one game element. When selecting any of the cells, we have to remove from the field the element and the entire related group of the same elements (see the figure below).
How would you implement the search for elements of such a group?

Design the solution to the problem in the form of js code using OOP principles, without using third-party frameworks and transpilers (babel, ts, etc.)
